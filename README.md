Hello to everyone this is a short explenation on how I approched this challange.

1) I used Insomnia to do all my testing and see if my methods work
2) I knew from the get go that I had to create a model, a repository and a controller
   in order to get the solve this challenge.
3) I created my model first of all
4) Then I search for a DB and I chose JSON.simple as I found plenty of examples and doc on how to use it
5) I then created my methods for reading and writing
   in the repo which I then called in my controller in order to test if the actually worked

In case I had more time I would like to add some testing
and make the getVehicleById method work better as it now returns a 200 when it does not id of the car.


Please let me know if you have any questions or if you require a more detailed readme file.

Kind regards,

Daniel
